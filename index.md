This set of tutorials and educational materials is being developed in the
[numpy-tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials) repository, and is
not a part of the NumPy source tree. The goal of this repository is to provide
high-quality resources by the NumPy project, both for self-learning and for
teaching classes with. If you're interested in adding your own content, check
the [Contributing](contributing.md) section.

To open a live version of the content, click the **launch Binder** button above.
To open each of the `.md` files, right click and select "Open with -> Notebook".
You can also launch individual tutorials on Binder by clicking on the rocket
icon that appears in the upper-right corner of each tutorial. To download a
local copy of the `.ipynb` files, you can either
[clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
or use the download icon in the upper-right corner of each tutorial.
