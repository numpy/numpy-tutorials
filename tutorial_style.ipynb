    "Guided by a template, you'll write a NumPy tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll be able to craft a tutorial that follows a standard format and reflects good teaching practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll learn the three standard headings that open a NumPy tutorial -- **What you'll do,** **What you'll learn,** and **What you'll need** -- and some optional headings for the bottom -- **On your own,** **In practice,** **Further reading.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll know what makes **What you'll learn** different from **What you'll do.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll be able to distinguish a **tutorial** from a **how-to**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll learn what not to put in a **What you'll learn** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll need\n",
    "\n",
    "- This template.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Informality and enthusiasm. Imagine your reader not out in the audience but next to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Willingness to write incomplete sentences for the **What you'll need** bullets. They don't begin with the words \"You'll need.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not** required are native English skills. Others can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## After a horizontal rule, start your own headings\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the tutorial you'll put another horizontal rule and return to standard headings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Titles have verbs\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, include a verb in the title; thus **Learn to write a NumPy tutorial** rather than **Rules for NumPy tutorials**. Consider putting verbs in the headings as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Titles are lowercase\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the first word is capitalized (so not **Titles Are Lowercase**).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to say in \"What you'll learn\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid abstraction. Rather than saying \"You'll learn about the quadratic equation,\" list skills (\"You'll be able to find the roots of a second-degree polynomial.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are \"What you'll do\" and \"What you'll learn\" different?\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll do** is typically one sentence listing a final product: \"You'll bake a cake.\" This makes the endpoint clear. **What you'll learn** lists the payoffs, and there may be many: \"You'll learn to follow a recipe. You'll get practice measuring ingredients. You'll learn how to tell when a cake is ready to come out of the oven.\"  \n",

    "\n",
    "> Don’t explain anything the learner doesn’t need to know in order to complete the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial steps are clear and easy; production-grade, probably not. Don't stop to qualify; do this after the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use plots and illustrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Figures are a double win; they amplify your points and make the page inviting.  Like English skills, artistic skills (or graphic-toolset skills) aren't required. Even if you only scan a hand illustration, somebody can polish it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An illustration below the title, even if it's only decorative, makes your page distinctive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use real datasets when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Readers are likelier to be engaged by a real use case. Be sure you have rights to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorials and how-to's  -- similar but different\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial readers are in a foreign country and want a feel for the terrain. The tutorial walks the reader through a solution, but the solution itself is subordinate. The journey is the destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike readers of a how-to, who know exactly what they need, tutorial readers don't know what it is they don't know. So while tutorials need headings like **What you'll do** and **What you'll learn**, these headings would never appear in a how-to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"tutorial\" itself, though presented in tutorial format, actually has a how-to goal and would normally be written as a how-to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make use of the Google doc style guide\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy docs follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/). In addition to providing answers to recurring questions (\"crossreference\" or \"cross-reference\"?) the guide is filled with suggestions that will strengthen your doc writing.\n",
