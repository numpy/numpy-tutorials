This set of tutorials and educational materials is being developed,
IT IS NOT INTEGRATED IN THE HTML DOCS AT <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/>

The goal of this repository is to provide high-quality resources by the
NumPy project, both for self-learning and for teaching classes with. If you're
interested in adding your own content, check the [Contributing](#contributing)
section.

To open a live version of the content, click the **launch Binder** button above.
You can also launch individual tutorials on Binder by clicking on the
rocket icon that appears in the upper-right corner of each tutorial.
To download a local copy of the `.ipynb` files, you can either
[clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
or use the download icon in the upper-right corner of each tutorial.

## Contributing

We very much welcome contributions! If you have an idea or proposal for a new
tutorial, please [open an issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues)
with an outline. 

Donâ€™t worry if English is not your first language, or if you can only come up
with a rough draft. Open source is a community effort. Do your best â€“ weâ€™ll help
fix issues.

Images and real-life data make text more engaging and powerful, but be sure what
you use is appropriately licensed and available. Here again, even a rough idea
for artwork can be polished by others.

### Why Jupyter Notebooks?

The choice of Jupyter Notebook in this repo instead of the usual format 
([reStructuredText][rst])
used in the main NumPy documentation has two reasons:


 * Jupyter notebooks are a common format for communicating scientific
   information.
 * rST may present a barrier for some people who might otherwise be very
   interested in contributing tutorial material.

### Adding your own tutorials

If you have your own tutorial in the form of a Jupyter notebook (an `.ipynb`
file) and you'd like to try add it out to the repository:

#### Create an issue

Go to <https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues> and create a new issue 
with your proposal.
Give as much detail as you can about what kind of content you would like to
write (tutorial, how-to) and what you plan to cover.
We will try to respond as quickly as possible with comments, if applicable.

#### Check out our suggested template

You can use this template to make your content consistent with our existing 
tutorials:

#### Upload your content

Remember to clear all outputs on your notebook before uploading it.
