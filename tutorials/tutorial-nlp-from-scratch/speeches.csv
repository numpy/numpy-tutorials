Greta Thunberg,"""My message is that we'll be watching you. This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suÔ¨Äering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! ""For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. ""You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe. ""The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5¬∞C, and the risk of setting oÔ¨Ä irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. ""Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice. They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. ""So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us ‚Äî we who have to live with the consequences.  ""To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5¬∞C global temperature rise ‚Äì the best odds given by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] ‚Äì the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on January 1st, 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons. ""How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just 'business as usual' and some technical solutions? With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than 8 1/2 years. ""There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. ""You are failing us. But young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you. ""We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.

Severn Suzuki,"Hello, I'm Severn Suzuki speaking for ""ECO"" -- the Environmental Children‚Äôs Organization. We are a group of 12 and 13 year-olds trying to make a difference: Vanessa Suttie, Morgan Geisler, Michelle Quigg, and me. We‚Äôve raised all the money to come here ourselves -- to come 5,000 miles to tell you adults you must change your ways. Coming up here today, I have no hidden agenda. I am fighting for my future. Losing my future is not like losing an election, or a few points on the stock market. I am here to speak for all generations to come. I am here to speak -- speak on behalf of the starving children around the world whose cries go unheard. I am here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet, because they have nowhere left to go. I am afraid to go out in the sun now, because of the holes in our ozone. I am afraid to breathe the air, because I don‚Äôt know what chemicals are in it. I used to go in -- I used to go fishing in Vancouver, my home, with my Dad until, just a few years ago, we found the fish full of cancers. And now we hear of animals and plants going extinct every day, vanishing forever. In my life, I have dreamt of seeing the great herds of wild animals, jungles, and rainforests full of birds and butterflies, but now I wonder if they will even exist for my children to see. Did you have to worry of these things when you were my age? All this is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all the time we want and all the solutions. I‚Äôm only a child and I don‚Äôt have all the solutions. I don't -- I want you to realize, neither do you. You don‚Äôt know how to fix the holes in our ozone layer. You don‚Äôt know how to bring the salmon back up in a dead stream. You don‚Äôt know how to bring back an animal now extinct. And you can‚Äôt bring back the forests that once grew where there is now a desert. If you don‚Äôt know how to fix it, please stop breaking it. Here, you may be delegates of your governments, business people, organizers, reporters, or politicians. But, really, you are mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles -- and all of you are someone‚Äôs child. I‚Äôm only a child, yet I know we are all part of a family -- five billion strong; in fact 30 million species strong -and borders and governments will never change that. I‚Äôm only a child, yet I know we are all in this together and should act as one single world towards one single goal.  But, really, you are mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles -- and all of you are someone‚Äôs child.

In -- In my anger, I'm not blind; and in my fear, I'm not afraid of telling the world how I feel. In my country we make so much waste, we buy and throw away, buy and throw away, buy and throw away and yet Northern countries will not share with the needy. Even when we have more than enough we are afraid to share; we are afraid to let go of some of our wealth. In Canada, we live the privileged life. We‚Äôve plenty of food, water, and shelter. We have watches, bicycles, computers, and television sets. The list could go on for two days. Two days ago, here in Brazil, we were shocked when we spent time with some children living on the streets. This is what one child told us: ""I wish I was rich and if I were, I would give all the street children food, clothes, medicines, shelter, and love and affection."" If a child on the streets who has nothing is willing to share, why are we who have everything still so greedy? I can‚Äôt stop thinking that these are children my own age, that it makes a tremendous difference where you are born; that I could be one of those children living in the favelas of Rio. I could be a child starving in Somalia, or a victim of war in the Middle East, or a beggar in India. I am only a child, yet I know if all the money spent on war was spent on finding environmental answers ending poverty and in finding treaties, what a wonderful place this Earth would be. At school, even in kindergarten, you teach us how to behave in the world. You teach us to not to fight with others, to work things out, to respect others, to clean up our mess, not to hurt other creatures, to share, not be greedy. Then, why do you go out and do -- do the things you tell us not to do? Do not forget why you are attending these conferences -- who you're doing this  At school, even in kindergarten, you teach us how to behave in the world.

But I don‚Äôt think you can say that to us anymore. Are we even on your list of priorities? My dad always says, ""You are what you do, not what you say."" Well, what you do makes me cry at night. You grown-ups say you love us. But I challenge you, please, make your actions reflect your words. Thank you.",NTU blogs
Martin Luther King,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree is a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But 100 years later the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later the life of the Negro is still badly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we‚Äôve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we‚Äôve come to our nation‚Äôs capital to cash a check. When the architects of our Republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men‚Äîyes, black men as well as white men‚Äîwould be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. . . . We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate into physical violence. . . . The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to distrust all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. . . . We cannot walk alone. And as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ‚ÄúWhen will you be satisfied?‚Äù We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro‚Äôs basic mobility is from a  smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their adulthood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ‚ÄúFor Whites Only.‚Äù We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and the Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. . . . I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still ¬©2014 The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History www.gilderlehrman.org  have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.‚Äù I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream . . . I have a dream that one day in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today . . . This will be the day when all of God‚Äôs children will be able to sing with new meaning. ‚ÄúMy country, ‚Äôtis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim‚Äôs pride, from every mountain side, let freedom ring.‚Äù And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New  Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado. Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California. But not only that. Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia. Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi, from every mountain side. Let freedom ring . . . When we allow freedom to ring‚Äîwhen we let it ring from every city and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God‚Äôs children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, ‚ÄúFree at last, Free at last, Great God amighty, We are free at last.‚Äù Reprinted by arrangement with The Heirs to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr., c/ o Writers House as the proprietor New York, NY.

Harvey Milk,"About six months ago, Anita Bryant in her speaking to God said that the drought in California was because of the gay people. On November 9, the day after I got elected, it started to rain. On the day I got sworn in, we walked to City Hall and it was kind of nice, and as soon as I said the word ""I do,"" it started to rain again. It's been raining since then and the people of San Francisco figure the only way to stop it is to do a recall petition. So much for that. Why are we here? Why are gay people here? And what's happening? Let's look at 1977. In 1977, gay people had their rights taken away from them in Miami. But you must remember that in the week before Miami and the week after that, the word homosexual or gay appeared in every single newspaper in this nation in articles both pro and con. In every radio station, in every TV station and every household. For the first time in the history of the world, everybody was talking about it, good or bad. Unless you have dialogue, unless you open the walls of dialogue, you can never reach to change people's opinion. Once you have dialogue starting, you know you can break down prejudice. In 1977 we saw a dialogue start. In 1977, we saw a gay person elected in San Francisco. What that is, is a record of what happened last year. What we must do is make sure that 1978 continues the movement. I know we are pressed for time so I'm going to cover just one more little point. That is to understand why it is important that gay people run for office and that gay people get elected. I know there are many people in this room who are running for central committee who are gay. I encourage you. There's a major reason why. If my non-gay friends and supporters in this room understand it, they'll probably understand why I've run so often before I finally made it. You see there is a major difference ‚Äì and it remains a vital difference ‚Äì between a friend and a gay person, a friend in office and a gay person in office. Gay people have been slandered nationwide. We've been tarred and we've been brushed with the picture of pornography. In Dade County, we were accused of child molestation. It's not enough anymore just to have friends represent us. No matter how good that friend may be. The black community made up its mind to that a long time ago. That the myths against blacks can only be dispelled by electing black leaders, so the black community could be judged by the leaders and not by the myths or black criminals. The Spanish  community must not be judged by Latin criminals or myths. The Asian community must not be judged by Asian criminals or myths. The Italian community must not be judged by the mafia, myths. And the time has come when the gay community must not be judged by our criminals and myths. Like every other group, we must be judged by our leaders and by those who are themselves gay, those who are visible. For invisible, we remain in limbo - a myth, a person with no parents, no brothers, no sisters, no friends who are straight, no important positions in employment. A tenth of the nation supposedly composed of stereotypes and would-be seducers of children ‚Äì and no offense meant to the stereotypes. But today, the black community is not judged by its friends, but by its black legislators and leaders. And we must give people the chance to judge us by our leaders and legislators. A gay person in office can set a tone, can command respect not only from the larger community, but from the young people in our own community who need both examples and hope. The first gay people we elect must be strong. They must not be content to sit in the back of the bus. They must not be content to accept pabulum. They must be above wheeling and dealing. They must be ‚Äì for the good of all of us ‚Äì independent, unbought. The anger and the frustrations that some of us feel is because we are misunderstood, and friends can't feel the anger and frustration. They can sense it in us, but they can't feel it. Because a friend has never gone through what is known as coming out. I will never forget what it was like coming out and having nobody to look up toward. I remember the lack of hope - and our friends can't fulfil it. I can't forget the looks on faces of people who've lost hope. Be they gay, be they seniors, be they blacks looking for an almostimpossible job, be they Latins trying to explain their problems and aspirations in a tongue that's foreign to them. I personally will never forget that people are more important than buildings. I use the word ""I"" because I'm proud. I stand here tonight in front of my gay sisters, brothers and friends because I'm proud of you. I think it's time that we have many legislators who are gay and proud of that fact and do not have to remain in the closet. I think that a gay person, up-front, will not walk away from a responsibility and be afraid of being tossed out of office. After Dade County, I walked among the angry and the frustrated night after night and I looked at their faces. And in San Francisco, three days before Gay Pride Day, a person was killed just because he was gay. And that night, I  walked among the sad and the frustrated at City Hall in San Francisco and later that night as they lit candles on Castro Street and stood in silence, reaching out for some symbolic thing that would give them hope. These were strong people, whose faces I knew from the shop, the streets, meetings and people who I never saw before but I knew. They were strong, but even they needed hope. And the young gay people who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant on television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone. So if there is a message I have to give, it is that I've found one overriding thing about my personal election, it's the fact that if a gay person can be elected, it's a green light. And you and you and you, you have to give people hope.",University of Maryland archives
Leymah Gbowee,"Thank you. Please have your seats. Someone once told me, the kids in America are born with whistles in their bellies. There is nowhere in the world that girls can scream like America. Thank you, President Spar. This is truly an honor. President Spar, Provost Bell, Board Chair Caruso, Dean Hinkson, faculty, student body, special guests, proud parents, distinguished ladies and gentleman, I‚Äôm honored to be here today at your 2013 Commencement. To God be the glory for another wonderful rainy day. My sisters sometimes say to me, I have some tendency that is a little bit leaning towards crazy. So, I read stuff. People do not go on websites and read negative things except they have a little mental issue. So, as I was preparing for this commencement, something took me to Barnard website. And there was this article, ‚ÄúWhy Leymah Gbowee Commencement Speaker?‚Äù And then after reading part of the article, I usually would just skip through and go down to the comments. Trust me, you all did well, as compared to some of the sites that I go on. But one of the comments that I like, because this site is BW-O-G, and it said, ‚ÄúHow awesome,‚Äù that was the comment, ‚Äúfor a G-B-O-W-E-E, to be speaking at Barnard, on, and then we‚Äôre talking about her on this site, B-W-O-G. So, if you switch it around, except for the W-E that is my last name, but you were very nice to me. I have been asked to send you off with some words of wisdom. I‚Äôll do my best on the wisdom part. Words you will definitely get. I ask you graduates to kindly focus for a moment, forget the parties afterwards. Forget the presents that are awaiting you out there, and just journey with me, briefly, on the term, ‚ÄúStep out of the shadows.‚Äù And most times when I‚Äôm speaking at commencements or speaking with girls or women, I tend to put on something that will cause you ‚Äì even if you forgot what I said, to remember me. Unfortunately, today, I don‚Äôt have one of my big head gears that will make you remember me, but please try to remember my pretty 41-year-old face. And I‚Äôm donning and 18-year old hair style. So if you forget anything I say, don‚Äôt forget, she had a hairstyle like her daughter.  Many years ago, I met an old woman. Her name was Krubo Pewee. She was quite poor, and lived in a shanty rundown home, but she had an air of confidence and independence. She walked with her shoulders up. Curiosity actually led me to seek this woman out. Every time I visited her, I would leave her some cash for food and medication, pitying her condition. She always hesitated taking the money from me. I would have to urge her before she reached out to take. One day, after several months of visitation and friendship, I handed her some money, and she said, thank you, but no thanks. She said, Leymah, I‚Äôm not one of those people to take money or to always take from people. I like giving back when I take. I‚Äôm a business woman. I love to watch my money grow, and I love to serve people through my business. If you want to do me a favor, give me a loan, so that I can restart my business. I asked her how much do you want? She said, 200 US dollars. In Liberian money, that is about $14,000. I took $250 and gave to her. Six months later, I went back to her tiny village. I saw a large kiosk, like a shop, rice, vegetables, and other provisions. I was shocked, but elated at the same time. She was more talkative, more relaxed, and we went on chatting about different things. As we talked, she asked about my children. And I told her about the headache of children being far away in school, and having to send money from Africa to the US, and she said ‚Äì I did that too. Of course I was shocked. You send money to the US? She said, yes. In the early 70s, my brother got a scholarship as an aircraft maintenance engineer from Liberia. And this scholarship only paid his fees. So, I had to send him money every month. So, I used to go and do bank drafts. Those were the days long before Western Unions or Money Grams. We talked about different things, and she revealed to me that from that kiosk, the previous one she had was what she used to educate that engineer, an IT consultant, a professional nurse, a community activist, and many more children of her relatives, siblings, and her own children. Again, I was shocked. Here is this woman, poor, sad, living in  a shanty home, talking about all of these great people that she had educated. But as we continued the conversation, I said, but you‚Äôve done well to do all of this, and she would not for one moment take any credit for educating those individuals. She referred to herself as a shadow. A shadow, what the shadow does, according to her, is accompany you. It is never active. It doesn‚Äôt feed or clothe you. I told myself, a concept of her role in these people‚Äôs lives was wrong, but who was I to argue with a 76-year-old woman? Shadow does nothing. And as I drove away from that place, I kept thinking about how she referred to herself. And it dawned on me that this is how all over the world, women think. They do a lot of the work, but they never really take any credit for what they do. Their roles in the success or the successes of all of the different things, they always try to keep in the shadows. Growing up, most times as young women and as girls, regardless of where you come from we are socialized as women to be humble. In very extreme cases, be seen and never heard. In some cases, walk on tiptoes. For many years, I heard the phrase, ‚ÄúAct like a lady.‚Äù To sum it all up, we are expected to live our lives in the shadows, but we are also told to contribute our quota to the growth and development of the world. I have a four-year-old who is going on 55, and she constantly comes back from my parents‚Äô house, and says, Momma, Grandma said, ‚ÄúGirls don‚Äôt jump up and down.‚Äù And then I say to her, ‚ÄúMok, Momma says, jump up and down as much as you want!‚Äù Grandma says, ‚ÄúGood girls should read their books and be quite.‚Äù And then I say, ‚ÄúMok Momma says, good girls should read their books and tell the world what they‚Äôve read.‚Äù The contradictions of our lives as women, is confusing for me as an activist, sometimes. Sometimes, it‚Äôs enraging, and other times, it‚Äôs a little bit entertaining. A few months ago, I dared to speak up against the current regime. One of my uncles is a minister in this current regime. And he called my dad, and this is the entertaining part. Why can‚Äôt you control your daughter? And my dad said to him, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs your niece. You go and control  her.‚Äù But between the two men who was supposed to be controlling me, no one dare come to control me. We are told, for those of us who frequent international conferences and meetings, this is the decade of the women. This is followed by local and international proclamations on the rights of women and girls. These proclamations, in my opinion, are made to get us to put our best foot forward; get our brains working, and other instances get our well-manicured nails dirty. However, we‚Äôve seen also many examples of the reality of our situation. For in this country, women can join the military, but until recently, could not engage in active combat. My interpretation was that we are not to be put up front. Our roles are to be positioned, uniquely, in the shadows. In many other part of the world, including my own country Liberia, it is a struggle to convince fathers, and sometimes mothers that their daughters are worthy of being in school, and not in the shadows of the home. The story of Malala took the world by storm. This is another example. In college, many of you spend four years, especially in a women's college, listening to the rhetoric of the world, rhetoric that we hear at all international meetings about women's roles, responsibilities, and rights. The real world, ladies, will teach you as it is still teaching me that it will never be handed down to you on flower beds of ease as my mother called it, or on a silver platter. You have to challenge, in most cases, keep your hand up, in other cases, and in some cases, break protocol if you are to step out of the shadows. You were also taught some of the stories of great women, women who have left great legacies, Harriet Tubman enslaved, mildly epileptic, Black, and a woman. Those were all qualities, and reasons for her to remain in the shadows. She refused to do so. She engaged one cause after the other. Susan B. Anthony, women's rights activist, freedom fighter, she refused to be in the shadows. She spoke up in her lifetime about the inequalities between men and women, and freedom for those enslaved. Her earlier fear of public speaking never  hindered her from stepping out of the shadows. These are just two examples of women of old in your context. Today there are many more that we could cite. The lessons these women have taught, and are still teaching us is that we must learn, decide, and fight to break out of the shadows; break out about your pains. I just came back from Libya where I heard horrid stories, horrible stories about rape and abuse during the revolution, and I was told the story of this young lady who was brutally raped. Her brothers locked her up, and because for them, her pain is to be kept in the shadows of their home, she broke free; ran away. They tracked her down, and killed her because she was to remain in the shadows. We went to this huge conference, and one of those young women who have also been in the shadows stepped out, and said, I want to speak about my rape. She came, covered in black, standing in that room that I called 98.2% of men, and told her story of how she was kept in a room with 80 other women raped daily, abused daily. The men in that room hung their head. I stood up, and applauded her because she refused to stay in the shadows of her pains. Don't stay in the shadows. Refuse to stay in the shadow. Break out about your dreams. Break out about your passion that you have for changing the world. Break out about how you feel about things. Never hold back. Refuse to be in the shadows as you step out into this life. Don't be shy no matter how crazy it seems to you. That crazy idea may just be the solution for some crazy global or local problem. From 1989 until 2003, the women of Liberia were also in the shadows. However, in 2003, tired of being used, and misused by over-drug militias, we stepped out to front the demons of militarism and violence. We refused to allow our bodies to be used anymore. We knew we would die, but we refused to allow our legacies to be ‚Äúthey died without trying.‚Äù We stepped out of the darkness of victimization, and into the light of activism and peace. We changed the global perception of Liberia being The Land of Child Soldiers to being The Land of Women in White. Today,  the peace that we strived for in Liberia has been translated into many empowerment, and refusal to be seen, and not heard. Community women are demanding their rights, demanding justice for perpetrators of crimes against women, and demanding the provisions of basic social services. We, as women of Liberia, are also demanding recognition for our contributions to the growth and development of our nation. Sheryl Sandberg, a good friend, and someone who I stand behind because she came ahead of me to Barnard writes in her book, Lean In, that women should step out, and unashamedly claim their spaces in their professional career striving to be out and on top. This, my dear ladies, can only happen if you step out of the shadows. I received a t-shirt once that read, ""Good girls never make history."" I love it because it encourages me to remain in the light, and never step back into the shadows. So, I started with the story of Krubo Peewee in August of 2013, one of those she educated died, the aviation engineer. I accompanied her to the family meeting planning the burial. The entire time no one acknowledged her, or recognized her. She sat in the back of the meeting sobbing quietly still hiding in the shadows somewhat hopeful that someone will recognize the role she played in this man's life. It never happened. On the day of the funeral, I went along with her. We sat in the church, and one-after-the-other people came, and paid tribute, and attributed his successes to one thing or the other; never the poor woman in the shanty run-down house. Finally, the pastor announced, if there were no more tributes, they will continue with the other aspects of the program. I was sitting, and screaming in my head, go for it, Krubo! Stand up. Say something. Step out of the shadows. And, as if she could hear my mental scream, she stood up, straightened her shoulders, and walked up to the podium. Here lies a man I saw so much ability in. I live my life through him. I did not go to school because our parents married me off early. And, because I could make money, I sent him to school, and she went on to talk about her brother, and everything she did. Afterwards, she turned to his children and his widow, and she  said to them, ‚ÄúIt's always good to recognize someone, anyone, regardless of their physical appearance when they have contributed to your success.‚Äù As she walked out of the church, I followed and went, yes! Distinguished graduates, as you journey through life, refuse to hide. Each and every one of you has unique skills and qualities that the world needs. Being in the shadow will continue to keep our dark world, darker. If all of you decide, or decided that this life you will step out, and do exactly what we need to do, you'll make the world a better place. Like Krubo Peewee, you may be forced to step out of the shadows. No matter how you decide to do so, always remember that stepping out of the shadows will ensure, your stepping out, will ensure that some girl will also find the strength to step out. Many years ago, I made that decision. Four children, dirt broke, dirt poor, only two underwear, until today, I am traumatized, so I buy underwear like a crazy person. I have to say that. Dirt poor, I went back to school, and I sat in my college classroom for three months, and never said a word. Every time someone raised their hand, and said something, I said to myself, I could have said it better. On this fateful day, I got this philosophy assignment, and I put my all into that assignment, went back, and presented my papers, psychology; not philosophy, went back, presented my paper to my professor, and when he brought it, I had an F. I looked at the paper, and something was telling me step out of the shadows. As long as you remain in the shadows, you will continue to receive F. I sat there, looked at that paper, looked, and thought, and looked, and thought, and mustered the courage; mustered the bravery. After class, walked up to the professor sweating like a goat during wintertime, sweating, really sweating profusely, shaking like a leaf, and I said to him, ‚ÄúSir, you miss-graded my paper.‚Äù He looked at me with a stern face, and said, because this is my first time speaking to this man in three months, ‚ÄúAre you sure‚Äù? And, I said, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I feel because I have never spoken up in class, you give me an F; you give me an F without reading my  paper. And then, he took it away from me, and said, if, and only in Africa the professor will do that, if you're telling a lie, you will be in trouble with me, and the only thing that rang in my head, he who is down, fear no fall. He went back, and brought that paper on Monday, and I got an A+. He saw the name, and never heard the voice, and thought that name is equivalent to F. As you step out, please, you're more than F. You're more than D. You're more than C. You're even more than B. I tell my children the alphabet starts from A, and that's what God has put in every woman in this world. You are an A. Refuse to be in the shadows. Because as you remain in the shadows, someone will miss-grade you, miss, or underpay you, misuse, abuse you. Refuse to remain in the shadow. Step out of the shadow. And you decide to step out of the shadow, just in case some father, brother, sister, mother, or former professor tries to tell you that a girl has never done this before, remind them that a woman came all the way from Africa to tell us, the world is upside down. Things are not what they used to be before. The Black man is one of the best golfers. White boys are playing basketball very well. Two women are president of Africa, and a White man and a Black man and his family now lives in The White House. Step out of the shadows, and be the best God created you to be. Congratulations, students. Thank you, parents. Well done, faculty. God bless us all. Thank you.",Barnard College - Columbia University official website
linda Thomas Greenfield ,"Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for convening us to commemorate this important day. And I thank the SecretaryGeneral, Madam High Commissioner, and Dr. Iweala, for your leadership in pressing us all to do more toward the elimination of racial discrimination, wherever and by whomever. This meeting ‚Äì this commemoration ‚Äì is personal to me. I am a person of African descent. But more importantly, I am a descendant of slaves. My great grandmother Mary Thomas, born in 1865, was the child of a slave. This is just three generations back from me. I grew up in the segregated South. I was bused to a segregated school, and on weekends, the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses on lawns in our neighborhood. When I was in high school, I was asked by a little girl, for whom I babysat, if I was an N-word because her dad had used that word for me. I know the ugly face of racism. I lived racism. I have experienced racism. And I survived racism. And through this process, I learned a simple truth: Racism is not the problem of the person who experiences it. Those of us who experience racism cannot, and should not, internalize it, despite the impact that it can have on our everyday lives. We must face it down, every time, no matter whom it‚Äôs directed towards. Racism is the problem of the racist. And it is the problem of the society that produces the racist. And in today‚Äôs world, that is every society. And in so many of our communities and countries, racism is endemic. It‚Äôs built in, like a rot in a frame. And it remains, and it festers, and it spreads because many of those in charge allow it to. Others look away and pretend it‚Äôs not there. But like a cancer, if ignored, it grows. Today, we commemorate our joint commitment to end all racial discrimination. And we take stock of our efforts during the midterm review of the Decade of People of African Descent. In America, conducting that review requires a reckoning ‚Äì a reckoning with our dark history of chattel slavery. Four-hundred-and-two years ago, African slaves were forced onto the shores of the colony of Virginia. Two years ago, the  1619 Project brought attention to this anniversary, and put the consequences of slavery, and the contributions of Black Americans, back at the center of our history and of our national narrative. As the project detailed, slavery is the original sin of America. It‚Äôs weaved white supremacy and black inferiority into our founding documents and principles. The Legacy Museum in Alabama traces this history, and if you‚Äôve not been there, I encourage you all to take a trip. Its exhibits draw a direct line from slavery to lynchings to segregation to mass incarceration and testify to this terrible history and the impact it is having on our people today. But even though slavery is our original sin, America is not the original source of slavery. Others share this shame with us. Slavery has existed in every corner of the globe. Africans enslaved fellow Africans long before the American colonists existed. And sadly, in many places around the world, slavery still exists today. As the scholar Isabel Wilkerson argues, humans in all contexts have ranked human value, pitting the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of others. In America, that takes many forms. Chief among them: our legacy of white supremacy. This year, the senseless killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many other Black Americans sparked a reckoning with racial justice, a movement that spread across the world: Black Lives Matter. And because Black Lives Matter, we need to dismantle white supremacy at every turn. This means looking at other kinds of hate, too. The FBI has reported a spike in hate crimes over the past three years ‚Äì particularly against Latino Americans, Sikhs, Muslim Americans, Jewish Americans, and immigrants. The most recent data shows hate crimes rising to a level not seen in over a decade. And that doesn‚Äôt even capture the bullying, discrimination, brutality, and violence that Asian Americans have faced since the outbreak of COVID-19. The mass shooting in Atlanta is only the latest example of this  horror. At President Biden‚Äôs direction, we are flying our flag at half-staff at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, to honor the victims of this terrible, senseless tragedy. It is so important we stand together ‚Äì we stand unified ‚Äì against this scourge. In unity, we have strength. But divisions and misperceptions about each other work against all of us. We also need to recognize that racism is far from unique in America. Across four decades and four continents in the Foreign Service, I experienced racism in countless international contexts, from overly zealous searches at airports, to police racially profiling my son, to being made to wait behind white patrons for a table at a restaurant. Racism was and continues to be a daily challenge wherever we are. And for millions, it‚Äôs more than a challenge. It‚Äôs deadly. Like in Burma, where Rohingya and others have been oppressed, abused, and killed in staggering numbers. Or in China, where the government has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. The prevalence, and pervasiveness, of racial discrimination might make the situation look hopeless. But let me be clear: I remain hopeful. I am hopeful because I have seen how communities and countries can enact change. And I have experienced that progress in my own lifetime. Personally, I am just one example of what hope and strength can do. After all, this descendant of slaves is before you today as the U.S. Representative to the United Nations. The first chapter of my life story ‚Äì born in poverty to uneducated parents ‚Äì this could not have been predicted. So I ask, what can we do to promote change and keep hope alive for victims of racism? We can‚Äôt control the hate in people‚Äôs heart. But we can change the rules that give them license. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôm sitting here. It‚Äôs why we were able to welcome Vice President Kamala Harris to the UN this week. It‚Äôs why President Biden‚Äôs cabinet is the most diverse in history and includes the first Native American named to a cabinet post.  We can make our communities, and our governments, reflect our highest aspirations ‚Äì even if some individuals still fall short. We can act. And in the Biden-Harris administration, we are doing just that. In the first 60 days, the President has made this a priority: from redressing racial discrimination in housing, to ending private prisons that warehouse young black and brown men, to respecting the sovereignty of Native American tribes, to combatting xenophobia and discrimination against Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders. The Biden-Harris Administration also recognizes how the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis has been disproportionately damaging to members of racial and ethnic minorities. So, we have taken steps, like providing emergency relief funds, increasing access to nutritious food, and passing* federal student loan payments, that we know will particularly help Black and brown communities. To be clear, this is just the beginning. Ending racial discrimination, particularly in our criminal justice system, will be an ongoing top priority for the President, and for the entire Biden-Harris Administration. And we ask that other countries join us. We call for all countries to ratify and implement the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. After all, this is about shaping the future. It‚Äôs shaping the future we want for our children, and our grandchildren, and their grandchildren. Already, they are demanding we do better. They are coming up with new ideas and they‚Äôre pushing for progressive action. They‚Äôre asking more from their politicians and their governments. And they‚Äôre in the streets, marching for charge. They say that ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter.‚Äù Because they do. They chant: ‚ÄúThis is what democracy looks like.‚Äù Because it is. This is the American way. We have flaws. Deep, serious flaws. But we talk about them. We work to address them. And we press on, in hopes that we can leave the country better than we found it.  We can do the same on a multilateral scale. Let us expose the racism and racial discrimination endemic in every society, around the globe. Let us press forward, to root out that discrimination and remove the rot from our foundations. And on this day dedicated to ending racial discrimination, as our flags fly at half-staff, let us leave our children a less hateful, more hopeful world. Let us give them a future. A future without fear. A future without violence. That is the legacy that I hope they can inherit. Thank you.",United States mission to the United Nation

Honorable UN Secretary General Mr Ban Ki-moon, respected president of the General Assembly Vuk Jeremic, honorable UN envoy for global education Mr Gordon Brown, respected elders and my dear brothers and sisters: Assalamu alaikum.

Today is it an honor for me to be speaking again after a long time. Being here with such honorable people is a great moment in my life and it is an honor for me that today I am wearing a shawl of the late Benazir Bhutto. I don't know where to begin my speech. I don't know what people would be expecting me to say, but first of all thank you to God for whom we all are equal and thank you to every person who has prayed for my fast recovery and new life. I cannot believe how much love people have shown me. I have received thousands of good wish cards and gifts from all over the world. Thank you to all of them. Thank you to the children whose innocent words encouraged me. Thank you to my elders whose prayers strengthened me. I would like to thank my nurses, doctors and the staff of the hospitals in Pakistan and the UK and the UAE government who have helped me to get better and recover my strength.

I fully support UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in his Global Education First Initiative and the work of UN Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown and the respectful president of the UN General Assembly Vuk Jeremic. I thank them for the leadership they continue to give. They continue to inspire all of us to action. Dear brothers and sisters, do remember one thing: Malala Day is not my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights.

There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers who are not only speaking for their rights, but who are struggling to achieve their goal of peace, education and equality. Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured. I am just one of them. So here I stand. So here I stand, one girl, among many. I speak not for myself, but so those without a voice can be heard. Those who have fought for their rights. Their right to live in peace. Their right to be treated with dignity. Their right to equality of opportunity. Their right to be educated.

Dear friends, on 9 October 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends, too. They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed. And out of that silence came thousands of voices. The terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions. But nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage was born.

I am the same Malala. My ambitions are the same. My hopes are the same. And my dreams are the same. Dear sisters and brothers, I am not against anyone. Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. I am here to speak for the right of education for every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all the terrorists and extremists. I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there was a gun in my hand and he was standing in front of me, I would not shoot him. This is the compassion I have learned from Mohammed, the prophet of mercy, Jesus Christ and Lord Buddha. This the legacy of change I have inherited from Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

This is the philosophy of nonviolence that I have learned from Gandhi, Bacha Khan and Mother Teresa. And this is the forgiveness that I have learned from my father and from my mother. This is what my soul is telling me: be peaceful and love everyone.

Dear sisters and brothers, we realize the importance of light when we see darkness. We realize the importance of our voice when we are silenced. In the same way, when we were in Swat, the north of Pakistan, we realized the importance of pens and books when we saw the guns. The wise saying, ""The pen is mightier than the sword."" It is true. The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them. This is why they killed 14 innocent students in the recent attack in Quetta. And that is why they kill female teachers. That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are afraid of change and equality that we will bring to our society. And I remember that there was a boy in our school who was asked by a journalist why are the Taliban against education? He answered very simply by pointing to his book, he said, ""a Talib doesn't know what is written inside this book.""

They think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would point guns at people's heads just for going to school. These terrorists are misusing the name of Islam for their own personal benefit. Pakistan is a peace loving, democratic country. Pashtuns want education for their daughters and sons. Islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. It is the duty and responsibility to get education for each child, that is what it says. Peace is a necessity for education. In many parts of the world, especially Pakistan and Afghanistan, terrorism, war and conflicts stop children from going to schools. We are really tired of these wars. Women and children are suffering in many ways in many parts of the world.

In India, innocent and poor children are victims of child labor. Many schools have been destroyed in Nigeria. People in Afghanistan have been affected by extremism. Young girls have to do domestic child labor and are forced to get married at an early age. Poverty, ignorance, injustice, racism and the deprivation of basic rights are the main problems, faced by both men and women.

Today I am focusing on women's rights and girls' education because they are suffering the most. There was a time when women activists asked men to stand up for their rights. But this time we will do it by ourselves. I am not telling men to step away from speaking for women's rights, but I am focusing on women to be independent and fight for themselves. So dear sisters and brothers, now it's time to speak up. So today, we call upon the world leaders to change their strategic policies in favor of peace and prosperity. We call upon the world leaders that all of these deals must protect women and children's rights. A deal that goes against the rights of women is unacceptable.

We call upon all governments to ensure free, compulsory education all over the world for every child. We call upon all the governments to fight against terrorism and violence. To protect children from brutality and harm. We call upon the developed nations to support the expansion of education opportunities for girls in the developing world. We call upon all communities to be tolerant, to reject prejudice based on caste, creed, sect, color, religion or agenda to ensure freedom and equality for women so they can flourish. We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave, to embrace the strength within themselves and realize their full potential.

Dear brothers and sisters, we want schools and education for every child's bright future. We will continue our journey to our destination of peace and education. No one can stop us. We will speak up for our rights and we will bring change to our voice. We believe in the power and the strength of our words. Our words can change the whole world because we ware all together, united for the cause of education. And if we want to achieve our goal, then let us empower ourselves with the weapon of knowledge and let us shield ourselves with unity and togetherness.

Dear brothers and sisters, we must not forget that millions of people are suffering from poverty and injustice and ignorance. We must not forget that millions of children are out of their schools. We must not forget that our sisters and brothers are waiting for a bright, peaceful future.

So let us wage, so let us wage a glorious struggle against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism, let us pick up our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world. Education is the only solution. Education first. Thank you.",Iowa state university archives
Michelle bachelet,"Distinguished Ministers, 
Excellencies,
Colleagues and friends, 

I am very pleased to be here, and I thank the Core Group for organizing today’s event, especially our co-chairs, Argentina and the Netherlands. 

It is fundamental to the cause of human rights that we promote equality, and the protection of all people from discrimination and violence. 

It should be obvious that there are many different ways to be a human being. We need to respect and embrace these differences -- not criminalise them, not attack people, not deprive them of equal rights or the protection of the law, just because they are seen as “different”. 

The struggle for the rights of LGBTI people is a core part of the human rights struggle. 

And yet in many parts of the world, members of the LGBTI community continue to be the targets of brutal attacks, many of which are left unpunished. 

It is essential that we defend and protect the LGBTI community, from every kind of violence and discrimination. 

There should be nothing “controversial” about stopping people being murdered, or executed by agents of the State, simply because of who they are or whom they love. Tackling extreme violence does not require new norms. 

Seventy years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed that everyone, without distinction “has the right to life, liberty and security of the person.” When there is a pattern of hate-motivated violence – one, for example, based on gender, sexual orientation or gender identity – and the State does not act to prevent, and effectively address, those attacks, it is failing to live up to that obligation. 

Excellencies, 

In a number of countries, there have been patterns of hate-motivated killings against lesbian, gay, bi and trans people by private actors and, sometimes, by local security forces or non-State armed groups. In some countries, trans women, in particular, have been at risk of such killings. 

Worse still, when the victims of attacks seek protection, they are frequently subjected to intimidation and abuse, including from police and justice officials. And most countries do not track homophobic and transphobic crimes. 

The result is impunity. Too many victims go without recognition, remedy or justice. Too many perpetrators are free to strike again, undeterred by the prospect of rule of law. 

Intersex people, too, face violence. There have been reports of the killing of young intersex babies. Some intersex children are subjected to harmful practices in medical settings. And very few States are taking action to protect intersex children from such harm. 

LGBTI people are entitled to equal protection, and the same rights as everyone else. 

I am encouraged by the fact that an unprecedented number of countries are now committed to taking action to prevent and address killings and violence against LGBTI people. 

But we need for all States to step up their efforts to address these crimes; to prevent extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; and to protect all people, without discrimination. 

Excellencies, 

Tragically, the issue is not only the inadequate response by the State to violence against LGBTI people. 

In seven countries, national or provincial laws provide for the execution of people convicted of acts related to homosexuality. I want to make clear that use of the death penalty in these circumstances is in complete violation of fundamental rights. 

More than 70 countries criminalize consensual same sex relationships, and also criminalize transgender people based on their appearance. These laws subject LGBT people to long prison sentences, and in some cases physical punishment. They also implicitly encourage prejudice, hatred and violence. 

But laws can change. 

In my country, Chile, following the brutal torture and murder of a young gay man in a Santiago park, six years ago, a very powerful and moving public discussion took place about the need to challenge hatred and violence towards the LGBT community. A bill, blocked for years in Parliament, was adopted – making it easier to punish homophobic and transphobic crimes. 

In India, we have just seen a landmark decision by the Supreme Court, decriminalising same-sex relationships. 

This important discussion is taking place all over the world. Not only in Europe and North America – it is moving forward in Africa, in Asia, in the Americas, in the Caribbean and in the Pacific. 

I welcome these vital changes. We need to see more countries taking steps to bring their laws and practices in line with the fundamental equality of all their people. 

But we need more. 

We need to change minds. 

At the core of killings and violence against LGBTI community is prejudice and hate. We will only prevent these crimes if we are brave enough to address these factors, across society. 

I am proud of the work my Office is doing to open people’s hearts and minds through its global Free & Equal campaign. This is one of the biggest UN public information initiatives ever undertaken, and it has reached hundreds of millions of people around the world. 

We also need education, education, education. Respect for diversity – including in relation to LGBTI people – should be reflected in school curricula and reinforced through effective public information campaigns. 

We need the business community, religious leaders, celebrities and the media to play a positive role. 

Excellencies, 

I believe that profound, positive change is possible. I have seen it in my own lifetime. It can be done. 

With your help, and the help of many others, we can prevent killings, violence, humiliation and fear in our LGBTI community. 

We can conquer hate. 

Thank you",United Nations office of high commisioner official website
