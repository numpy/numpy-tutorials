X-ray image analysis can be part of your data analysis and [machine learning workflow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235291481930214X) when, for example, you're building an algorithm that helps [detect pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge) as part of a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/eduardomineo/u-net-lung-segmentation-montgomery-shenzhen).

Next, you apply the [Prewitt filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator) on each of the 2 axes of the image to help detect some of the edges — this will result in 2 gradient values. Similar to the Sobel filter, the Prewitt operator also applies two 3x3 kernel matrices — one for each axis — onto the X-ray through a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)#Convolution). In the end, you compute the magnitude between the two gradients using the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) and [normalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_%28image_processing%29) the images, as before."

Then, calculate two gradients using [`scipy.ndimage.prewitt()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.prewitt.html).
